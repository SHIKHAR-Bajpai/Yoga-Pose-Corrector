            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-main_heading" id="yoga-heading1">#1 Yoga Means Union</h3>
            <p><strong className='font-semibold text-main_heading'>Sadhguru:</strong> In the western part of the world, if you utter the word “Yoga,” people think of impossible physical postures. This is a very distorted idea of what Yoga is. Yoga is not about bending and twisting your body or holding your breath. It is a mechanism and a technology to get you to that state of experience where you see reality just the way it is.</p>
          <p>The word “Yoga” literally means “union.”</p>
          <p>As you sit here, your idea and your sense and experience of who you are is very strong. You are here as an individual. But what the trees are exhaling right now, you are inhaling; what you are exhaling, the trees are inhaling. In other words, one half of your lung is hanging out there. This is not just in terms of breath. Today, modern physics is proving to you that as you sit here, every subatomic particle in your body is in constant transaction with everything else in the existence. If this transaction stops, you will cease to exist. So, Yoga means to know the union of existence by experience.</p>
          <p>Modern science is proving to you that the whole existence is just one energy. The religions of the world have been saying for a long time that God is everywhere. Whether you say, “God is everywhere,” or you say, “Everything is one energy,” we are talking about the same reality. It is just that a scientist has never experienced this – he has arrived at it through mathematical deductions; a religious person has not experienced it – he believes it because it is written somewhere or has been said by someone.</p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 text-main_heading" id="yoga-heading2">#2 Yoga Signifies a Complete Path by Itself</h3>
          <p>What Yoga means is to move towards an experiential reality where one knows the ultimate nature of the existence, the way it is made. Essentially, in the tradition, once we attach the word “Yoga” to anything, it indicates that it is a complete path by itself. We say “Hatha Yoga,” but we will not say “Asana Yoga.”</p>
          <p>If it was just a simple practice or an exercise, you could approach it one way. If it was an art form or just entertainment, it could be approached another way. Today, people say “Recreational Yoga,” “Health Yoga,” or people refer to it as an art form. They think they are doing a service to Yoga by saying it is an art form. No. The moment you attach the word “Yoga,” it indicates it is a complete path by itself.</p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 text-main_heading" id="yoga-heading3">#3 Yoga Means to Break the Cycle of Life</h3>
          <p>All aspects of physicality in the universe are cyclical. Planets are going around the sun, the solar system is moving, and everything in the galaxy and the cosmos is cyclical. The more you are identified with your physical system, the more cyclical you are. Your experiences and the process of life is cyclical. If you watch carefully enough, even the situations that you face in your life come in cycles.</p>
          <p>If you are going in circles, it just gives you an impression that you are going somewhere but you are not really going anywhere; you are going through the same thing again and again. Yoga means to open up the circle and stretch it out like a straight line, so that if you follow the line you will go somewhere – you are not going round and round. Many of you may have already experimented and noticed. Let’s say you might have been doing sadhana for a few years. If you just stop your sadhana for three months, you will see so many compulsions that you never imagined were a part of you, which were have been gone for a long time, suddenly all become a part of you.</p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 text-main_heading" id="yoga-heading4">#4 Yoga Means Liberating Yourself from Memory</h3>
          <p>Repetitive cycles of compulsiveness are happening because there are various types of memories in the system. There is a huge volume of memory – genetic memory, evolutionary memory, elemental memory, atomic memory, karmic memory, inarticulate memory, and articulate memory. If this memory was not there, your body would not even take a form. There are so many billions of people on the planet, but everyone took this form – two legs, two hands, two eyes. When you were in your mother’s womb, your body knew it has to take on this form. If the memory was not there, we do not know what form it would have taken.</p>
          <p>You have retained your physical form this way only because of memory. Memory always means that which is past. If you go and watch a cinema, what happens so big and so real, more real than the real. It becomes a bigger reality than reality because it is so exaggerated. But all this is just memory being played out. It is recorded in a film or a digital format or whichever way, but it is just memory, it is already over. If the information that you carry, which is memory, is the only thing which determines the nature of who you are right now, that means you are past. There is no real life; it is just a play of memory.</p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 text-main_heading" id="yoga-heading5">#5 Yoga is a Technology for Transformation</h3>
          <p>Yoga is a technology, not a belief system or philosophy. The only way to know this is to become a Yogi, because then you will see the difference in your own being, in your own experience. If you want to know what Yoga is, the easiest way is to take the help of a competent master and practice it properly.</p>
          <p>If you are stuck with your mind or emotions or physical limitations, Yoga is the technology to open that up and make your existence an ever-expanding possibility. This is why, in the Yogic tradition, there is no one who is just a practitioner. If you call yourself a Yogi, you must be someone who is exploring your own ultimate nature every moment.</p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 text-main_heading" id="yoga-heading6">Misconceptions About Yoga</h3>
          <p>There are three common myths about Yoga that many people believe:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li id="myth1"><strong>Yoga Is a Philosophy</strong> — Yoga is not just a philosophical belief or religion, it is a technology for inner transformation.</li>
            <li id="myth2"><strong>Yoga Is All About Postures</strong> — Yoga is not merely physical exercises or poses; it is about aligning your body, mind, and energies towards wellbeing and self-realization.</li>
            <li id="myth1"><strong>Yoga Is an Exercise to Stay Healthy</strong> — While Yoga certainly improves health, its goal goes far beyond physical fitness to the full blossoming of your human potential.</li>
